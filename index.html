				<!-- Intro -->
				<h1>Hi!</h1>
				<p>I am a student at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" class="link">University of California, Berkeley</a> majoring in Data Science.</p>
				<p>I'm a cap fanatic, dog lover, and audiophile. The chance of anyone seeing me without earbuds in is almost negligible.</p>
				<p>Here is a more formal <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yIINXhUakuUE3wbUJlwR9cjmmbaVZnJcpv3rRpuEY0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="link">resume</a>.</p>

				<h2>What I Do</h2>
					<h3>Doe/Moffitt Circulation</h3>
					<p>I work as a Library Student Employee for Doe/Main Stacks and Moffitt Library.
						Through our circulation services, we serve ~45,000+ people. During my shifts,
						I administer devices (laptops, chargers, keys, etc.) to patrons.

				<h2>What I've Done</h2>
					<h3>Gitlet</h3>
					<p>The goal of the project was to implement a version-control system that has the basic 
						features of Git. I created the project from scratch and established a design document 
						to manage the project. Through this project, I was able to gain a clearer understanding 
						on the functionality of Git and starting a project from scratch. To see my code, please
						email me with a request.

					<h3>S1XT33N: Voice-Controlled Car</h3>
					<p>The goal of this project was to make a voice-activated robot. I breadboarded the robot circuit
						and modified the breadboard for areas that did not meet the design specifications. Through this
						project, I learned how to breadboard different types of filters that allowed for the car to be
						voice-activated.

					<h3>Wordguesser</h3>
					<p>The goal of this project was to create a website that is playable once published. Through
						this project, I was able to explore the use of Ruby and Cucumber and make a functioning
						website game.

					<h3>Jump 61B</h3>
					<p>The goal of this project was to program a simpler version of <a href="http://www.playonlinedicegames.com/jumpingcube" 
						target="_blank" class="link">KJumping Cube game</a> (rules are laid out in spec). One requirement
						of the project was to be able to play against a computer. I developed an AI that could play against 
						a human player. Through this project, I created own tests to ensure code satisfied the rules of the 
						game. To see my code, please email me with a request.

					<h3>Enigma</h3>
					<p>The goal of this project was to build a simulator for a generalized version of Enigma 
						machines that were used by the Germans during WWII. I designed multiple roters/reflectors 
						to do different permutations required to make a fully functioning enigma machine. Through
						this project, I was able to execute a functioning enigma machine and utilize different data
						structures. To see my code, please email me with a request.

					<h3>Ants VS Somebees</h3>
					<p>The goal of this project was to create a game inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies_(video_game)" target="_blank" class="link">
						Plants vs. Zombies</a>. Through this project, I learned the basics of object oriented 
						programming. To see my code, please email me with a request.

					<h3>Cats: Automated Typing Software</h3>
					<p>The goal of this project was to create a game inspired by <a href="https://play.typeracer.com" target="_blank" class="link">
						Typeracer</a>. Through this project, I learned how to utilize recursion and practice
						using python. To see my code, please email me with a request.</p>
